## Wellnessliving frontend developer screening assignment

### General recommendations:

* try to use Typescript features
* try to write simple code which will be easy to understand
* do not use any 3rd party packages
* use git commits to fix your changes, then return zip folder as result 

### Implement `first` function in `index.ts`

Find the first element in alphabetical order for an array of strings using a loop.
For example, for this array: a=['my','name','is','john','doe']; the result should be 'doe'.

Check result by this command
```npx ts-node index.ts```

### Implement `second` functions in `index.ts`

There is an array of objects with 3 fields:

`userId` - user ID

`message` - text of the message

`createdAt` - date and time of message

Write a function to retrieve texts of every last message for every user.

Check result by this command
```npx ts-node index.ts```

### Write tests for these functions in `index.test.ts`

Check result by this command
```npm run test```
